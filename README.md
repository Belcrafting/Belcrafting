Most of these ports and other things are made by other people, I just want to play games at school :P
I also helped my friend make his own google site. I may or may not make a site of my own using Github to host it rather then google sites.

I also have a youtube channel. It's here as well, it's [BelSomethingSomething.](https://www.youtube.com/@Belgaminglol)

If you want, maybe go visit my site on google sites, it's right over here, just click [here](https://sites.google.com/online.houstonisd.org/the-noises-game-store/update-logs)
